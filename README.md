In this project, we have successfully presented a Prediction of Life Expectancy Of Patient Using Machine Learning that utilizes historical data to train simple machine learning models which are more accurate and can help us know Whether the Patient is going to survive or not after Thoracic Surgery. The models can be run on much less resource intensive environments. From the 4 models built, we have selected the best model and saved in pkl format. Finally, we have successfully built a web application to predict the Life Expectancy of Patient After Thoracic Surgery.
